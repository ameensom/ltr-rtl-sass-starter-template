# LTR-RTL SASS Starter Template
> It's time to move on from css, give your self a head start with this template.

Many front end developers would make the UI for LTR and then manually change the direction to RTL or use a css LTR to RTL converter and the final results would still need some tweaking.
This template would help you move on past that, you would just write the sass/scss code once and it will automatically compile the LTR/RTL css files for you.
Along with that it'll Autoprefix, Beautify and/or Minify the final css files.

## Installing / Getting started
If you already have Node.js,SASS and Git installed you can skip the prerequisites.

### Prerequisites
This package depends on the following packages and it should be installed on your machine.
>[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

>[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install)

>[Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.

## Installation
Download the repository to your machine as zip file or clone it to your dekstop by running the following command in the terminal / command line, then installing NPM packages.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ameensom/ltr-rtl-sass-starter-template.git
cd ltr-rtl-sass-starter-template/
npm install
```
- First command will copy the repository to your local machine.
- Second command will go inside the folder.
- Third command will install the required packages to run the tool from npm.

### Building
After installing the npm packages needed just enter the following command :
```bash
gulp
```
that will open up the browser at `http://localhost:3000` from there you can click on the language interface you need, and you'll see the default **index.html** file that i've included with the project.

## How to use
While writing your sass/scss code, use the following variables `$direction` `$reverse-direction` instead of `Right` and `Left`.

### Example
**As a value**
```scss
.selector {
text-align: $direction;
float: $reverse-direction;
}
```
The css output would be as following :

*LTR*
```css
.selector {
	text-align: left;
	float: right;
}
```
*RTL*
```css
.selector {
	text-align: right;
	float: left;
}
```
**As a key**
```scss
.selector-#{$direction} {
	padding-#{$direction}: 10px;
	#{$direction}: 10px
	padding-#{$reverse-direction}: 40px;
	#{$reverse-direction}: initial;
}
```
The css output would be as following :

*LTR*
```css
.selector-left {
	padding-left: 10px;
	left: 10px;
	padding-right: 40px;
	right: initial;
}
```
*RTL*
```css
.selector-right {
	padding-right: 10px;
	right: 10px;
	padding-left: 40px;
	left: initial;
}
```
**Additional Use**

You can use `$language` variable with `@if` `@else`  conditions to specify styles for each interface.
```scss
body {
	@if($language == 'ar') {
	    direction: rtl;
	}
  height: 100%;
 }
```
The css output would be as following :

*LTR*
```css
body {
	height: 100%;
}
```
*RTL*
```css
body {
	direction:rtl;
	height: 100%;
}
```
Note :
There are other variables you can use, look at `source\abstract\variables.scss` for more.
### File Structure

```
### HTML Files
You should manually add your HTML files inside of **`build\ltr`** and **`build\rtl`**.

### SCSS Files
Start creating your custom UI by editing the scss files as your need, like any other scss project, however there are some lines that shouldn't be edited and/or not removed , I've added comments next to it.

## Features

* Compile your sass/scss files as css to two different folders or more, and adjust the directions as per the interface language direction.
* [BrowserSync.io](https://browsersync.io/) integration, which will provide you with auto reload of the browser upon saving html,js and scss files.
* [AutoPreFixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer),[BeautifyCSS](https://github.com/koistya/gulp-csscomb) based on [CSSComb](http://csscomb.com/) options,[MinifyCSS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-minify-css) are also integrated and you can choose to enable or disable it from the configuration.
* Easy to read file structure.
* Cool mixins included.
